        improve your experience when you use this website and to ensure that it
        is functioning effectively, we (or our service providers) also use
        cookies (small text files stored in a user’s browser) and web beacons

        employer; (ii) third parties such as providers of ‘know your client’ and
        anti-money laundering services which we use to help us meet our legal
        requirements in this area and to help us verify your identity where we
        provide you with products or services; (iii) background check providers
        which we sometimes use to verify your identity when you apply for a
        product of ours; (iv) third party service providers that help us to

        public or judicial authorities with the necessary authorization.{" "}

        diligence checks in advance of providing products or services to you,
        and to process an application from you or a prospective client to
        receive products or services from us. If you are referred to us by an
