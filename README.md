## Installation

The frontend is developed using CRA + vite so to install it on your local machine, I suggest the following steps.

1. Locate the project remote repository and grab (copy) the repository's ulr (SSH or HTTP).
2. Go to your terminal or whatever to create a folder to save the project using the following prompt: `mkdir <folder-name>`
3. Move into the file directory by `cd <folder-name>`
4. initialize the space by `git init`
5. `git remote add origin <paste the url from #1>`
6. `git fetch`
7. `git pull`
8. `npm install`
9. `npm run dev` and all things being equal, **<http://127.0.0.1:5173>** should be opened up as local server to view updates in real time.
